## Introduction

Using the World Health Organization (WHO) data compiled by Kumar Rajarshi, Deeksha Russell, and Duan Wang, we developed three different models:
- The first model was designed to be easily interpreted using linear regression.
- The second model was designed to be used as a predictive tool using linear regression.
- The third model was developed using non-parametric methods for prediction.

## Data Description

The description and context of the Life Expectancy (WHO) data set can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who). Data has been compiled from several different data sets into a final data set that represents health factors for 193 countries between the years of 2000-2015.

```{r load-data, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Load data
df <- read_csv(here::here("data - raw", "Life Expectancy Data.csv"))

# Clean up column names
df_clean <- janitor::clean_names(df)

# Look at the data
glimpse(df_clean)
```

Looking at the data, there are 2,938 observations and 22 variables that cover various social, economic, and health-related factors.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

We'll start by taking a closer look at life expectancy.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
df_clean %>% 
  ggplot(aes(life_expectancy)) +
  geom_histogram(fill = "steelblue", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Histogram of Life Expectancy",
       x = "Age",
       y = "Count") +
  theme_ipsum()

df_clean %>% 
  ggplot(aes(sample = life_expectancy)) +
  geom_qq(pch = 21, size = 3, na.rm = TRUE) +
  geom_qq_line(color = "indianred", na.rm = TRUE) +
  labs(title = "Quantile-Quantile Plot of Life Expectancy",
       x = "Theoretical",
       y = "Sample") +
  theme_ipsum()
```

```{r convert-to-factor, echo=FALSE}
# Convert country and status to factors
df_clean$country <- as_factor(df_clean$country)
df_clean$status  <- as_factor(df_clean$status)
```

### Check for Correlation

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
ggcorr(
  df_clean,
  label = TRUE,
  label_alpha = TRUE,
  label_size = 3,
  layout.exp = 2,
  cex = 3.5,
  hjust = 1
)
```

We examined various correlation matrices to determine whether there were variable(s) that should be addressed. We'll start by removing redundant variables and picking ones with fewer `NA` values.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
df_clean %>% 
  select(-c(under_five_deaths, gdp, thinness_1_19_years)) %>% 
  ggcorr(
  label = TRUE,
  label_alpha = TRUE,
  label_size = 3,
  layout.exp = 2,
  cex = 3.5,
  hjust = 1
)
```

Let's now look at what happens when we also remove `population`, since it has minimal correlation to `life_expectancy`.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
df_clean %>% 
  select(-c(under_five_deaths, gdp, thinness_1_19_years, population)) %>% 
  ggcorr(
  label = TRUE,
  label_alpha = TRUE,
  label_size = 3,
  layout.exp = 2,
  cex = 3.5,
  hjust = 1
)
```

We'll proceed, dropping the columns we've looked at.

```{r echo=FALSE}
df_clean <- df_clean %>% 
  select(-c(under_five_deaths, gdp, thinness_1_19_years, population))
```

### Deal with Missing Values

Check for missing values.

```{r echo=FALSE}
# Check for missing values
tibble(variable = names(colSums(is.na(df_clean))),
       missing = colSums(is.na(df_clean))) %>% 
  gt()
```

Drop all rows where life expectancy is `NA`. We will limit scope of our analysis to not include these countries.

```{r}
# Check which countries have NA rows for life expectancy
df_clean$country[which(is.na(df_clean$life_expectancy))]

# Drop all rows where life expectancy is NA
df_clean <- df_clean %>% 
  filter(!is.na(life_expectancy))

# Recheck missing value counts
tibble(variable = names(colSums(is.na(df_clean))),
       missing = colSums(is.na(df_clean))) %>% 
  gt()
```

We have now excluded these countries from our scope: Cook Islands, Dominica, Marshall Islands, Monaco, Nauru, Niue, Palau, Saint Kitts and Nevis, San Marino, and Tuvalu.

Hepatitis B is now our variable with the most `NA`'s at 553. Let's see if there is either a year or a country that has the majority of the `NA`'s.

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Look at how many missing hepatitis measurements there are by country
df_clean %>% 
  group_by(country) %>% 
  count(missing = is.na(hepatitis_b)) %>% 
  filter(missing == TRUE) %>% 
  select(-missing) %>% 
  rename(missing = n) %>% 
  arrange(desc(missing))

#Visualize the relationship to see if it looks significant
df_clean %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = hepatitis_b, y = life_expectancy)) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_smooth() +
  labs(title = "Hepatitis B vs. Life Expectancy",
       x = "Hepatitis B",
       y = "Life Expectancy")
```

Our options are to either drop all of the `NA`'s, impute the values, or fill with `0`'s. For our interpretable model, let's drop the `NA`'s and we will revisit them for our predictive model.

```{r echo=FALSE}
# Drop hepatitis B variable 
df_interp <- df_clean %>% 
  select(-hepatitis_b)

# Drop remaining rows with NA's for the interpretable model
df_interp <- na.omit(df_interp)

# Final check of missing values
tibble(variable = names(colSums(is.na(df_interp))),
       missing = colSums(is.na(df_interp))) %>% 
  gt()
```

### Analysis of Years

Now that we've subsetted our variables and dealt with `NA`'s, let's look at how many records we now have by year.

```{r echo=FALSE}
df_interp %>% count(year)
```

Our feature engineering dropped almost all of the records from 2015. Let's go with the most recent "good" sample size (2011-2014) and again limit scope to these years only.

```{r}
df_interp <- df_interp %>% filter(year %in% 2011:2014)

```

## Build the Model

Now that we've finished our feature engineering, let's start building our interpretable model.

```{r echo=FALSE}
# Set the maximum number of variables to consider in the model. Although the
# model can handle up to 20, the more we add, the less interpretable the final
# model will be.
consider <- 17

# Fit the model. We'll remove country, but keep it in the data set for
# interpretation.
regfit_full <-
  regsubsets(life_expectancy ~ .,
             df_interp[, -1],
             nvmax = consider)

# Store the regression summary
reg_summary <- summary(regfit_full)
```

```{r}
# Look at the names of reg_summary
names(reg_summary)

# What are the R-squared values?
reg_summary$rsq
```

### Plot the RSS, adjusted $R^2$, $C_p$, and BIC for all Models

```{r echo=FALSE}
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
plot(reg_summary$rss,
     xlab = "Number of Variables",
     ylab = "RSS",
     type = "l")
plot(reg_summary$adjr2,
     xlab = "Number of Variables",
     ylab = "Adjusted RSq",
     type = "l")
which.max(reg_summary$adjr2)
points(
  11,
  reg_summary$adjr2[which.max(reg_summary$adjr2)],
  col = "red",
  cex = 2,
  pch = 20
)
plot(reg_summary$cp,
     xlab = "Number of Variables",
     ylab = "Cp",
     type = "l")
which.min(reg_summary$cp)
points(
  9,
  reg_summary$cp[which.min(reg_summary$cp)],
  col = "red",
  cex = 2,
  pch = 20
)
plot(reg_summary$bic,
     xlab = "Number of Variables",
     ylab = "BIC",
     type = "l")
which.min(reg_summary$bic)
points(
  5,
  reg_summary$bic[which.min(reg_summary$bic)],
  col = "red",
  cex = 2,
  pch = 20
)
```

Now we'll look at the selected variables for the best model with a given number of predictors.

```{r echo=FALSE}
plot(regfit_full, scale = "r2")
plot(regfit_full, scale = "adjr2")
plot(regfit_full, scale = "Cp")
plot(regfit_full, scale = "bic")
```

The model with the lowest BIC is the five-variable model that contains `adult_mortality`, `percentage_expenditure`, `total_expenditure`, `hiv_aids`, and `income_composition_of_resources`. We can use the `coef()` function to see the coefficient estimates associated with this model.

```{r echo=FALSE}
coef(regfit_full, 5)
```

### Run Forward and Backward Stepwise Selection

```{r echo=FALSE}
# Forward
regfit_fwd <-
  regsubsets(
    life_expectancy ~ .,
    data = df_interp[,-1],
    nvmax = 17,
    method = "forward"
  )
summary(regfit_fwd)

# Backward
regfit_bwd <-
  regsubsets(
    life_expectancy ~ .,
    data = df_interp[,-1],
    nvmax = 17,
    method = "backward"
  )
summary(regfit_bwd)

# How many variables do we want to use?
x <- 4

# Compare coefficients
tibble(
  variables = names(coef(regfit_full, x)),
  full = round(coef(regfit_full, x), 4),
  fwd = round(coef(regfit_fwd, x), 4),
  bwd = round(coef(regfit_bwd, x), 4)
) %>%
  gt()
```

### Choose Using Validation Set

```{r warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# Set seed
set.seed(123)

# Build test and training data sets, dropping country from regfit_best &
# test_mat because I was getting a warning that 1 linear dependencies found
train <- sample(c(TRUE, FALSE), nrow(df_interp), rep = TRUE)
test <- (!train)
regfit_best <- regsubsets(life_expectancy ~ ., data = df_interp[train, -1])
test_mat <- model.matrix(life_expectancy ~ ., data = df_interp[test, -1])

# Run a loop, and for each size `i`, extract the coefficients from `regfit_best`
# for the best model of that size, multiply them into the appropriate columns of
# the test model matric to form the predictions, and compute the test MSE.
val_errors <- rep(NA, 8)
for (i in 1:8) {
  coefi <- coef(regfit_best, id = i)
  pred <- test_mat[, names(coefi)] %*% coefi
  val_errors[i] <- mean((df_interp$life_expectancy[test] - pred)^2)
}
```

```{r}
# Find the best model
val_errors
coef(regfit_best, which.min(val_errors))
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
# Write a prediction function
predict_regsubsets <- function(object, newdata, id, ...) {
  form <- as.formula(object$call[[2]])
  mat <- model.matrix(form, newdata)
  coefi <- coef(object, id = id)
  xvars <- names(coefi)
  mat[, xvars] %*% coefi
}

# Perform best subset selection on the full data set, and select the best model.
regfit_best <- regsubsets(life_expectancy ~ ., data = df_interp[,-1])
coef(regfit_best, which.min(val_errors))
```

### Choose Using Cross-Validation

```{r echo=FALSE}
k <- 10
set.seed(123)
folds <- sample(1:k, nrow(df_interp), replace = TRUE)
cv_errors <- matrix(NA, k, consider, dimnames = list(NULL, paste(1:consider)))

predict.regsubsets <- function(object, newdata, id, ...) {
  form <- as.formula(object$call[[2]])
  mat <- model.matrix(form, newdata)
  coefi <- coef(object, id = id)
  mat[, names(coefi)] %*% coefi
}

# Perform cross-validation
for (j in 1:k) {
  best_fit <-
    regsubsets(life_expectancy ~ ., data = df_interp[folds != j, -1], nvmax = consider)
  for (i in 1:15) {
    pred <- predict(best_fit, df_interp[folds == j, -1], id = i)
    cv_errors[j, i] <-
      mean((df_interp$life_expectancy[folds == j] - pred) ^ 2)
  }
}

# Use the apply function to average over the columns of the matrix in order to
# obtain a vector for which the jth element is the cross-validation error for
# the j-variable model.
mean_cv_errors <- apply(cv_errors, 2, mean)
mean_cv_errors
par(mfrow = c(1, 1))
plot(mean_cv_errors, type = "b")

# Perform best subset selection on the full data set in order to obtain the
# variables for the final model
reg_best <- regsubsets(life_expectancy ~ ., data = df_interp[, -1])
coef(reg_best, 4)  # the number sets the number of variables we want
```

### Build the Final Model

```{r}
# Build the final model using the best subset selection results
final_model <-
  lm(
    life_expectancy ~ adult_mortality +
      total_expenditure +
      hiv_aids +
      income_composition_of_resources,
    data = df_interp
)
```

### Inspect Model and get MSE

```{r}
# Final model summary
final_model_summary <- summary(final_model)
final_model_summary

# Get MSE
mean(final_model_summary$residuals ^ 2)

# Augment model
final_model_aug <- broom::augment(final_model)

# Confidence intervals
confint(final_model)
```

### Check Diagnostics

```{r echo=FALSE}
par(mfrow = c(1, 1))
plot(
  final_model$fitted.values,
  df_interp$life_expectancy,
  xlab = "Predicted",
  ylab = "Life Expectancy"
)
lines(c(0, 90), c(0, 90), col = "red")

par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(final_model)
```

### Fit our Model to our Data Set

```{r echo=FALSE}
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
test.model <- lm(life_expectancy ~ ., df_interp[, -1])
plot(test.model$fitted.values,
     test.model$residuals,
     xlab = "Fitted Values",
     ylab = "Residuals")
plot(df_interp$life_expectancy,
     test.model$residuals,
     xlab = "Life Expectancy",
     ylab = "Residuals")
```

$Life~Expectancy = 47.106 - 0.013(Adult~Mortality) + 0.289(Total~Expenditure) - 0.911(HIV/AIDS) + 36.649(Income~Composition~of~Resources)$

### Interpretation of Regression Coefficients

We are 95% confident that the model's intercept is between (45.41, 48.689) and the true regression coefficient's for the predicted variables are: adult mortality (-0.016, -0.01), total expenditure (0.183, 0.359), HIV/AIDS (-1.062, -0.772), and income composition of resources (34.999, 38.894).

## Linear Prediction Model

Let's start again with the `df_clean` data set to perform feature engineering. We have already removed at this point variables that are highly correlated and rows/countries with `NA` for life expectancy. This leaves us with 17 other potential predictors and still quite a few `NA` values. We know we cannot have `NA` values to perform Ridge Regression or LASSO so need to either remove them, impute them, or change them to 0.

### Deal with missing values

```{r echo=FALSE}
# Check for missing values
tibble(variable = names(colSums(is.na(df_clean))),
       missing = colSums(is.na(df_clean))) %>% 
  gt()
```

Let's start by checking the relationships of each variable with \> 100 `NA`'s to see if they appear significant.

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#Visualize the relationship to see if it looks significant (plot again)

# hepatitis b
df_clean %>% ggplot(aes(x = hepatitis_b, y = life_expectancy)) +
  # geom_point() +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_smooth() +
  labs(title = "Relationship of Hepatitis B and Life Expectancy",
       x = "Hepatitis B",
       y = "Life Expectancy") +
  theme_ipsum()

# total expenditure
df_clean %>% ggplot(aes(x = total_expenditure, y = life_expectancy)) +
  # geom_point() +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_smooth() +
  labs(title = "Relationship of Total Expenditure and Life Expectancy",
       x = "Total Expenditure",
       y = "Life Expectancy") +
  theme_ipsum()

# alcohol
df_clean %>% ggplot(aes(x = alcohol, y = life_expectancy)) +
  # geom_point() +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_smooth() +
  labs(title = "Relationship of Alcohol and Life Expectancy",
       x = "Alcohol",
       y = "Life Expectancy") +
  theme_ipsum()

# income composition of resources
df_clean %>% ggplot(aes(x = income_composition_of_resources, y = life_expectancy)) +
  # geom_point() +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_smooth() +
  labs(title = "Relationship of Income Composition of Resources\nand Life Expectancy",
       x = "Income Composition of Resources",
       y = "Life Expectancy") +
  theme_ipsum()

# schooling
df_clean %>% ggplot(aes(x = schooling, y = life_expectancy)) +
  # geom_point() +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_smooth() +
  labs(title = "Relationship of Schooling and Life Expectancy",
       x = "Schooling",
       y = "Life Expectancy") +
  theme_ipsum()
```

The trend looks pretty flat for `hepatitis_b`, `total_expenditure`, and `alcohol` so I think it is safe for us to go ahead and remove these columns. However, there appears to be some relationship for `schooling` and possibly for `income composition of resources` as well, so instead of imputing these values let's go ahead and remove the `NA`'s for these two variables.

```{r echo=FALSE}
#remove hepatitis b and total_expenditure
df_predict <- df_clean %>% 
  select(-c(hepatitis_b, total_expenditure, alcohol))

#remove the remaining NA's
df_predict <- na.omit(df_predict)

#check for NA's
tibble(variable = names(colSums(is.na(df_predict))),
       missing = colSums(is.na(df_predict))) %>% 
  gt()
```

We now have 2,728 observations and 15 variables. Let's proceed to variable selection.

```{r}
#replot after removing Na's

# income composition of resources
df_predict %>% ggplot(aes(x = income_composition_of_resources, y = life_expectancy)) +
  # geom_point() +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_smooth() +
  labs(title = "Relationship of Income Composition of Resources\nand Life Expectancy",
       x = "Income Composition of Resources",
       y = "Life Expectancy") +
  theme_ipsum()

# schooling
df_predict %>% ggplot(aes(x = schooling, y = life_expectancy)) +
  # geom_point() +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_smooth() +
  labs(title = "Relationship of Schooling and Life Expectancy",
       x = "Schooling",
       y = "Life Expectancy") +
  theme_ipsum()
```


## Ridge Regression

```{r}
library(glmnet)

# Ridge regression and lasso require the format 'x matrix' and 'y'. The
# model.matrix() function produces a matrix and automatically transforms
# qualitative variables into dummy variables.
x <- model.matrix(life_expectancy ~ ., df_predict[,-1])[, -1]
y <- df_predict$life_expectancy

# Run ridge regression
ridge_mod <- glmnet(x, y, alpha = 0)
dim(coef(ridge_mod))

# Split data into training and testing sets
set.seed(1)
train <- sample(1:nrow(x), nrow(x)/2)
test <- (-train)
y_test <- y[test]

# Fit a ridge regression model on the training set, and evaluate its MSE on the
# test set
ridge_mod <- glmnet(x[train, ], y[train], alpha = 0)
ridge_pred <- predict(ridge_mod, s = 4, newx = x[test, ])
mean((ridge_pred - y_test) ^ 2)

# The test MSE is 17.4224. If we had simply fit a model with just an intercept,
# we would have observed each test observation using the mean of the training
# observations. In that case, we could compute the test set MSE like this:
mean((mean(y[train]) - y_test) ^ 2)

# We could also get the same result by fitting a ridge regression model with a
# very large value of ƛ.
ridge_pred <- predict(ridge_mod, s = 1e10, newx = x[test, ])
mean((ridge_pred - y_test) ^ 2)

# Use cross-validation to choose the tuning parameter ƛ.
set.seed(1)
cv_out <- cv.glmnet(x[train, ], y[train], alpha = 0)
plot(cv_out)
bestlambda <- cv_out$lambda.min
bestlambda

# What is the test MSE associated with bestlambda?
ridge_pred <- predict(ridge_mod, s = bestlambda, newx = x[test, ])
mean((ridge_pred - y_test) ^ 2)

# Refit the ridge regression model on the full data set using the value of ƛ
# chosen by cross-validation
out <- glmnet(x, y, alpha = 0)
predict(out, type = "coefficients", s = bestlambda)[1:14,]
```

## Lasso

```{r}
# Fit the lasso model
lasso_mod <- glmnet(x[train, ], y[train], alpha = 1)

# Plot the lasso model
plot(lasso_mod)

# Run cross-validation and compute the associated test error
set.seed(1)
cv_out <- cv.glmnet(x[train, ], y[train], alpha = 1)
plot(cv_out)
bestlambda <- cv_out$lambda.min
lasso_pred <- predict(lasso_mod, s = bestlambda, newx = x[test, ])
mean((lasso_pred - y_test) ^ 2)

# Compute lasso coefficients
out <- glmnet(x, y, alpha = 1)
lasso_coef <- predict(out, type = "coefficients", s = bestlambda)[1:14,]
lasso_coef[lasso_coef != 0]
```

## KNN Model

For the KNN model, we will try to impute some values based on the distribution (either choosing the mean, median, or 0) and test how that impacts our metrics. To determine whether or not to impute, and what value to use, we reviewed the histograms of each variable with NA values to determine if we should impute the mean, median, or 0. Based on the histograms and distributions, we decided to impute the median for `hepatitis_ B_b`, `polio`, `total_expenditure`, and `diptheria`, the mean for `bmi`, `income_composition_of_resources`, and `schooling`, and 0 for `alcohol` and `thinness_5_9_years`.

```{r}
# Copy the data
df_knn <- df_clean
#Make new data set that does not impute values for comparison
df_knn2 <- df_clean
df_knn2 <- drop_na(df_knn2)

# Impute the data set
df_knn <- df_knn %>%
  mutate(across(
    c(polio, total_expenditure, diphtheria),
    ~ replace_na(., median(.x, na.rm = TRUE))
  )) %>% 
  mutate(across(
    c(bmi, income_composition_of_resources, schooling),
    ~ replace_na(., mean(.x, na.rm = TRUE))
  )) %>% 
  mutate(across(
    c(alcohol, thinness_5_9_years),
    ~ replace_na(., 0)
  ))

#remove hepatitis b to match above
df_knn <- df_knn %>%
  select(-hepatitis_b)

# # Check the histograms to see if there any shifts after imputing
# for (col in 4:ncol(df_knn)) {
#     hist(df_knn[,col], main=names(df_knn[col]))
# }

#check for NA's
tibble(variable = names(colSums(is.na(df_knn))),
       missing = colSums(is.na(df_knn))) %>% 
  gt()

# Set seed
set.seed(123)

# Standardize the data to prep for KNN first - everything except life expectancy
preProcValues <- preProcess(df_knn[, -4], method = c("scale"))
df_knn_standard <- predict(preProcValues, df_knn)

# Split training/test data sets
inTraining <-
  createDataPartition(df_knn_standard$life_expectancy,
                      p = 0.75,
                      list = FALSE)
knn_train  <- df_knn_standard[inTraining, ]
knn_test   <- df_knn_standard[-inTraining, ]

# Perform same splits for data with NA's removed
# Standardize the data to prep for KNN first - everything except life expectancy
preProcValues_2 <- preProcess(df_knn2[, -4], method = c("scale"))
df_knn_standard2 <- predict(preProcValues_2, df_knn2)

# Split training/test data sets
inTraining2 <-
  createDataPartition(df_knn_standard2$life_expectancy,
                      p = 0.75,
                      list = FALSE)
knn_train_na  <- df_knn_standard2[inTraining2, ]
knn_test_na   <- df_knn_standard2[-inTraining2, ]
```



```{r}
# Set seed
set.seed(567)

# Set train control: 5 repeat, 10-fold CV

  train(

    data = knn_train,
    method = "knn",
    trControl = ctrl,
    tuneGrid = expand.grid(k = c(1, 3, 5)) #run only with k = 1, 3, 5
  )
knnFit2

```

Based on our training data set, we have surprisingly good results with the imputed data set and all of the predictors. Our RMSE is around 3 and our Rsquared is in the 90's. Since the Rsquared is so high, there is risk of over-fit. Let's also run another model using our KNN data set where we just removed the `NA` values instead of imputing them.

```{r}

# Run knn on data set with NA's removed
knnFit_na <-
  train(
    life_expectancy ~ .,
    data = knn_train_na,
    method = "knn",
    trControl = ctrl,
    tuneLength = 10 #run through 10 different k's
  )
knnFit_na

# Check the metrics on the test set
Predictions_knn_na <- predict(knnFit_na, newdata = knn_test_na)
ASE_knn_na <- mean((Predictions_knn_na - knn_test_na$life_expectancy)^2)
ASE_knn_na

# Performance measurement
postResample(knn_test_na$life_expectancy, Predictions_knn_na)

```

Even with a smaller data set, the metrics are still pretty good but we do see some decline in Rquared and an increase in RMSE and ASE. 

## Variable Selection for KNN

Let's now test KNN using the same 4 predictors from our first linear model and compare our results with all of the predictors.

```{r}
knnFit3 <-
  train(
    life_expectancy ~ adult_mortality +
      total_expenditure +
      hiv_aids +
      income_composition_of_resources,
    data = knn_train,
    method = "knn",
    trControl = ctrl,
    tuneLength = 10
  )
knnFit3

```

```{r}
#check metrics on test set
Predictions_knnfit3 <- predict(knnFit3,newdata=knn_test)
#performance measurement
postResample(knn_test$life_expectancy,Predictions_knnfit3)
ASE_knn3 <- mean((Predictions_knnfit3 - knn_test$life_expectancy)^2)
ASE_knn3

plot(knnFit3)  
plot(knnFit3, metric = "Rsquared")
plot(knnFit3, metric = "MAE")
```


We see that using all of the predictors and then comparing with just the four ones we deemed important from our first model (which was on a much more limited data set) gives us approximately the same adj R2 value and RMSE. When applying to our test data set, it does not appear that our models are over-fitting as we do not see a big shift in our metrics, even though an adj R2 in the 90's is normally a warning sign for an over-fitting model.

## Check for Over Fit

Let's create one more train/test split for our KNN models to verify our metrics and confirm there is no over-fitting, as we are suspicious of the high Rsquared values which are typically indicative of overfit.

```{r}
# Split training/test data sets - round 2
set.seed(1)
inTraining_x <-
  createDataPartition(df_knn_standard$life_expectancy,
                      p = 0.75,
                      list = FALSE)
knn_train_x  <- df_knn_standard[inTraining_x, ]
knn_test_x   <- df_knn_standard[-inTraining_x, ]

# Run everything with the train control above
knnFit_x <-
  train(
    life_expectancy ~ .,
    data = knn_train_x,
    method = "knn",
    trControl = ctrl,
    tuneLength = 10
  )
knnFit_x

# Check the metrics on the test set
Predictions_knnFit_x <- predict(knnFit_x, newdata = knn_test_x)
ASE_x <- mean((Predictions_knnfit_x - knn_test_x$life_expectancy)^2)
ASE_x

# Performance measurement
postResample(knn_test_x$life_expectancy, Predictions_knnFit_x)

# Plotting
plot(knnFit_x, main = "knnFit Results")  
plot(knnFit_x, metric = "Rsquared", main = "knnFit Results (R-Squared)")
plot(knnFit_x, metric = "MAE", main = "knnFit Results (MAE)")

# Try another knn with a k value of less than 5
knnFit2_x <-
  train(
    life_expectancy ~ .,
    data = knn_train_x,
    method = "knn",
    trControl = ctrl,
    tuneGrid = expand.grid(k = c(1, 3, 5))
  )
knnFit2_x

# Check the metrics on the test set
Predictions_knnFit2_x <- predict(knnFit2_x, newdata = knn_test_x)
ASE_x <- mean((Predictions_knnfit3_x - knn_test_x$life_expectancy)^2)
ASE_x

# Performance measurement
postResample(knn_test_x$life_expectancy, Predictions_knnFit2_x)

# Plotting
plot(knnFit2_x, main = "knnFit2 Results")  
plot(knnFit2_x, metric = "Rsquared", main = "knnFit2 Results (R-Squared)")
plot(knnFit2_x, metric = "MAE", main = "knnFit2 Results (MAE)")

knnFit3_x <-
  train(
    life_expectancy ~ adult_mortality +
      total_expenditure +
      hiv_aids +
      income_composition_of_resources,
    data = knn_train_x,
    method = "knn",
    trControl = ctrl,
    tuneLength = 10
  )
knnFit3_x

# Check the metrics on the test set
Predictions_knnFit3_x <- predict(knnFit3_x, newdata = knn_test_x)
ASE_3x <- mean((Predictions_knnfit3_x - knn_test_x$life_expectancy)^2)
ASE_3x

# Performance measurement
postResample(knn_test_x$life_expectancy, Predictions_knnFit3_x)


# Plotting
plot(knnFit3_x, main = "knnFit2 Results")  
plot(knnFit3_x, metric = "Rsquared", main = "knnFit2 Results (R-Squared)")
plot(knnFit3_x, metric = "MAE", main = "knnFit2 Results (MAE)")

```

## Trees

Let's run some tree models to see if we get better metrics that we think may be less susceptible to over-fitting.

```{r}
# Set seed
set.seed(123)

# Split training/test data sets
inTraining <- createDataPartition(df_knn$life_expectancy, p = 0.75, list = FALSE)
tree_train  <- df_knn[inTraining,]
tree_test   <- df_knn[-inTraining,]

# Remove country because this tree function has a maximum of 32 levels
tree1 <- tree(life_expectancy ~ ., data = tree_train[, -1])
summary(tree1)
plot(tree1)

# Check tree performance
cv.tree1 <- cv.tree(tree1)
plot(cv.tree1$size, cv.tree1$dev, type = 'b')

# Check the predictions
yhat = predict(tree1, newdata = tree_test[, -1])
plot(yhat, tree_test$life_expectancy)
abline(0, 1)
mean((yhat - tree_test$life_expectancy) ^ 2)

# Try a random forest compared to a single tree model
set.seed(1)

# Remove country again
rfFit <- randomForest(life_expectancy ~ ., data = tree_train[, -1])
rfFit

# Test using all predictors for each tree
set.seed(1)

# Have to remove country again - using top 4 predictors
rfFit2 <- randomForest(life_expectancy ~ adult_mortality +
      total_expenditure +
      hiv_aids +
      income_composition_of_resources, data = tree_train[,-1])
rfFit2

#compare y-hat for the two random forest models
yhat.rf <- predict(rfFit, newdata = tree_test[, -1])
yhat.rf2 <- predict(rfFit2, newdata = tree_test[, -1])

# Performance measurement
postResample(tree_test$life_expectancy, yhat.rf)
postResample(tree_test$life_expectancy, yhat.rf2)

ASE_rf <- mean((yhat.rf - tree_test$life_expectancy)^2)
ASE_rf

ASE_rf2 <- mean((yhat.rf2 - tree_test$life_expectancy)^2)
ASE_rf2

plot(yhat.rf, tree_test$life_expectancy)
abline(0,1)

plot(yhat.rf2,tree_test$life_expectancy)
abline(0,1)
```

The random forest model that includes all predictors has smaller ASE than the random forest model that only includes the four important variables we used in our interpretable model.

## Check for overfit again

Let's do another train/test split also for the random forest to check for overfitting, as the Rsquared values for RF are much higher than KNN.

```{r}
# Set seed
set.seed(1)

# Split training/test data sets
inTraining_t <- createDataPartition(df_knn$life_expectancy, p = 0.75, list = FALSE)
tree_train_x  <- df_knn[inTraining_t,]
tree_test_x   <- df_knn[-inTraining_t,]

# Try a random forest compared to a single tree model
set.seed(567)

# Remove country again
rfFit_x <- randomForest(life_expectancy ~ ., data = tree_train_x[, -1])
rfFit_x

# Test using all predictors for each tree
set.seed(5)

# Have to remove country again - using top 4 predictors
rfFit2_x <- randomForest(life_expectancy ~ adult_mortality +
      total_expenditure +
      hiv_aids +
      income_composition_of_resources, data = tree_train_x[,-1])
rfFit2_x

#compare y-hat for the two random forest models
yhat.rf_x <- predict(rfFit_x, newdata = tree_test_x[, -1])
yhat.rf2_x <- predict(rfFit2_x, newdata = tree_test_x[, -1])

# Performance measurement
postResample(tree_test_x$life_expectancy, yhat.rf_x)
postResample(tree_test_x$life_expectancy, yhat.rf2_x)

plot(yhat.rf_x, tree_test_x$life_expectancy)
abline(0,1)

plot(yhat.rf2_x,tree_test_x$life_expectancy)
abline(0,1)
```
